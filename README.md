# Chess
This is a minimalistic implementation of chess. The Chess file is my backend implementation, and the Board file is a small frontend implementation using tkinter. When running the Board file, a seperate GUI window will pop up, where you can play by pressing on a piece, and then on the square you want it to move.
The following rules have been added:
- Normal piece moves
- 
The following rules are yet to be added:
- Checks and checkmates
- Player turns
- An Passant
- Castling
- Pawn promotion
- Stalemate
-
